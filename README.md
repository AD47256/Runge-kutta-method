Description: 
 Abstract:
 The code creates generic template class of Runge-Kutta method, which can be used to give numerical solution of ODE system like Lorenz system.
 
 The functions component_sum and container_sum provide a way to deal with algebra operation of generic input type, making it easier to create classes of Runge-Kutta method of different order.
 Attached files are 
1. Numerical solution of a Lorenz system of by 3rd and 4th order Runge-Kutta method (lorenz_3.txt and lorenz_4.txt).
2. 3D graph of a Lorenz system (graph with 4th order.png).
3. 3D animation of a Lorenz system (animation.gif).
